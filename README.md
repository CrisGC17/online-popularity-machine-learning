Repository containing the Capstone project I developed at General Assembly, London, for the Data Science Immersive course (June-Sept 2017)
+ Capstone: Online News Popularity

+ Data set has been taken form UCI repository please refer to the link (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) 

+In recent years the style and nature of the Press Releases has changed. Sharing news is clearly impacting on how people find news today. In this analysis, I address the problem of predicting online news popularity based on the number of shares of articles. I needed to find a model to explain why some news stories have more share than others and identify a group of variables to predict popularity.


 
+This capstone project consists of 3 notebooks:

+ Notebook 1: 

+- 1.1 Data Mining. I collected all the past data and then searching for the pattern in this data. Saving as a local PostgreSQL

+- 1.2 Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering Analysis


+ Notebook 2: Machine Learning

+- 2.1 Features: all initial colums

+- 2.2 Features: applying PCA components


+ Notebook 3: Predicting with the article content
 
+- 3.1 Web Scraping, applying NLP techniques to create features extracted from the Body and Title 

+- 3.2 Predicting with the article content: Naive Bayes & Random Forest
